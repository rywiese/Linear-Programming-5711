\subsection{Part 1}

\begin{figure}[h] % "h" is where to place, h=here, t=top, b=bottom

$f(x) = x^4 - 6x^3 + 3x^2 + 10x$\\
$f'(x) = 4x^3 - 18x^2 + 6x + 10 = 0$\\
This has roots $x \approx -.57$, $x \approx 1.1$, and $x \approx 4$. Based on the graph, it is clear that $x \approx -.57$ and $x \approx -4$ are local minimizers, with $x 
\approx -4$ being the global minimizer.

\subsection{Part 2}

\end{figure}

The feasible set of figure 2 is the green shaded region (including all of its boundaries). The local minimizers are the point $(-2, 0)$ as well as the segment of line $x_1 = 1$ that is in the feasible region (The left edge of the green shaded region on the right). The global minimizer is the point $(-2, 0)$. 

\section{Problem 2}

\subsection{Part 1}

$\nabla f(x,y,z) = 
\left( \begin{array}{c}
     4x + y - 6\\
     x + 2y + z - 7\\
     y + 2z - 8\\
\end{array} \right) = 
\left( \begin{array}{c}
     0\\
     0\\
     0\\
\end{array} \right)$
\\\\
The candidate has coordinates $x = 1.2$, $y = 1.2$, and $z = 3.4$.

\subsection{Part 2}

$\nabla^2 f(x,y,z) = 
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
    4 & 1 & 0\\
    1 & 2 & 1\\
    0 & 1 & 2\\
\end{array} \right)$

which has eigenvalues .83, 2.79, and 4.48, which are all positive. Thus $\nabla^2 f(x,y,z)$ is positive definite. So the candidate is a local minimum.

\subsection{Part 4}

I obtained an optimal value of -30.4 with the same (roughly) values for $x, y,$ and $z$. My MATLAB code is included as P2.m.

\section{Problem 3}

I'm really sorry, I've been dealing with some personal issues lately and I will do better on the next assignment.
